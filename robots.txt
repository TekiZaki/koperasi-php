# robots.txt for koperasi-php

# This file tells search engine crawlers (like Googlebot) which pages
# or directories they should not access on your site.

# Important Considerations:
# 1. This is a suggestion, not an enforcement. Malicious bots may ignore it.
# 2. Files disallowed here can still be indexed if linked from other sites.
# 3. Use with caution: Blocking essential files (like CSS/JS) can harm SEO.
